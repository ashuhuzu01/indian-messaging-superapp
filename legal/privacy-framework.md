# Samvaad Privacy & Data Protection Framework

## Privacy Vision

Samvaad is built on a foundation of privacy and transparency. We believe that robust privacy protections are not only critical for user trust but are a fundamental right. Our approach to privacy is not to merely comply with regulations, but to exceed expectations by making privacy a core product value.

## Guiding Principles

### Privacy by Design
Privacy considerations are integrated into every feature from inception rather than added as an afterthought. We proactively identify and address privacy implications throughout the development lifecycle.

### Data Minimization
We collect only the data necessary to provide and improve our services. If we don't need it, we don't collect it.

### User Control
Users should have meaningful control over their data, with clear choices and transparency about what data is collected and how it's used.

### Secure by Default
Strong security is the foundation of privacy. We implement industry-leading security measures at all levels of our platform.

### Transparency
We communicate clearly about our data practices in language that users can understand, avoiding legal jargon and technical complexity.
