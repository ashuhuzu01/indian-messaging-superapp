## Design Implications

These personas highlight several key implications for our product design:

1. **Multi-modal Interfaces**: We need to support both text and voice-first interaction models to serve different user segments.

2. **Language Depth**: Beyond surface translation, we need deep language integration with cultural context awareness.

3. **Performance Variability**: The app must function well across vastly different device and network capabilities.

4. **Progressive Complexity**: Features should be progressively revealed based on user comfort and capability.

5. **Trust Building**: Clear, transparent explanations are needed for all features involving sensitive data.

6. **Contextual Help**: In-app guidance should be available based on user behavior and profile.

7. **Offline Functionality**: Core features must work with intermittent connectivity.

8. **Inclusive Design**: Accessibility should be a core consideration, not an afterthought.

These personas will be continuously refined based on ongoing user research and feedback during product development.
