# Samvaad Feature Prioritization Framework

## Prioritization Methodology

To ensure strategic feature development, Samvaad uses a structured prioritization framework that evaluates each potential feature through multiple lenses. This framework helps maximize user value while balancing technical feasibility and business impact.

## Evaluation Criteria

Each feature is scored on a scale of 1-5 across the following dimensions:

### User Impact (UI)
- **5**: Transformative - Fundamentally changes how users interact with the app
- **4**: Significant - Substantially improves core user journeys
- **3**: Moderate - Meaningful improvements to existing functionality
- **2**: Incremental - Small improvements with limited scope
- **1**: Minimal - Barely noticeable to most users

### Technical Feasibility (TF)
- **5**: Very Easy - Can be implemented with existing components
- **4**: Easy - Requires minor adjustments to existing systems
- **3**: Moderate - Requires new components but within existing architecture
- **2**: Difficult - Requires architectural changes or complex integrations
- **1**: Very Difficult - Requires fundamental redesign or unproven technology

### Business Impact (BI)
- **5**: Critical - Direct impact on primary business objectives
- **4**: High - Strong contribution to key metrics
- **3**: Moderate - Positive impact on secondary metrics
- **2**: Low - Indirect or uncertain business benefits
- **1**: Minimal - No clear business case beyond feature parity

### Market Differentiation (MD)
- **5**: Unique Innovation - Not available in any competing app
- **4**: Leader - Better implementation than any competitor
- **3**: Competitive - On par with leading competitors
- **2**: Catch-up - Bringing us to parity with competitors
- **1**: Behind - Still behind competitors even after implementation

### User Reach (UR)
- **5**: Universal - Benefits all user segments
- **4**: Broad - Benefits majority of users across segments
- **3**: Moderate - Benefits multiple user segments
- **2**: Narrow - Benefits one specific user segment
- **1**: Niche - Benefits only a very small subset of users

## Scoring and Prioritization

The total score for each feature is calculated as:
```
Score = (UI × 0.3) + (TF × 0.2) + (BI × 0.2) + (MD × 0.15) + (UR × 0.15)
```

This weighted formula emphasizes user impact while balancing other important considerations.

### Priority Tiers

Features are grouped into priority tiers based on their scores:

| Tier | Score Range | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| P0 | 4.5 - 5.0 | Must-have features for MVP launch |
| P1 | 3.8 - 4.4 | High priority features planned for early releases |
| P2 | 3.0 - 3.7 | Medium priority features for later releases |
| P3 | 2.0 - 2.9 | Low priority features to consider after core functionality |
| P4 | 1.0 - 1.9 | Features to reconsider or deprioritize |
